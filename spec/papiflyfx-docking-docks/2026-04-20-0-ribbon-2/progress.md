## Accomplishments

- [2026-04-20] Completed Phase 1 API refactor: UI-neutral `BoolState`/`MutableBoolState`, typed `RibbonContext` capabilities, `collapseOrder` rename, and provider/sample compile fixes.
- [2026-04-21] Completed Phase 2 runtime command architecture: long-lived `CommandRegistry`, canonical command identities through `RibbonManager.refresh()`, and ID-first Quick Access Toolbar persistence/rendering.
- [2026-04-21] Ran the required on-host preflight validation for Phases 1 and 2 before starting new refactors:
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-api,papiflyfx-docking-docks -am compile` → `BUILD SUCCESS`
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-api,papiflyfx-docking-docks -am -Dtestfx.headless=true test` → `BUILD SUCCESS` (`79` tests before Phase 3; `84` after Phase 3)
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-samples,papiflyfx-docking-github,papiflyfx-docking-hugo -am compile` → `BUILD SUCCESS`
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.1 — Reworked ribbon rendering to reconcile cached tab/group/control nodes instead of recreating them on every refresh:
  - `RibbonTabStrip` now reuses tab buttons keyed by tab id and emits deterministic cache-hit/rebuild telemetry.
  - `Ribbon` now caches `RibbonGroup` instances per `(tabId, groupId)` and only requests adaptive relayout when selection/structure actually changes.
  - `RibbonGroup` now caches control nodes per `(controlId, RibbonGroupSizeMode)` and reuses them across steady-state refreshes and collapse transitions.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.1 — Replaced the old “reset every group to LARGE then shrink” layout pass with an incremental shrink/grow policy:
  - shrink uses the Phase 1 invariant (`smaller collapseOrder` collapses earlier; ties collapse from higher `order` downward)
  - grow restores in reverse order
  - steady-state refreshes no longer schedule avoidable `Platform.runLater(...)` batches when the visible structure is unchanged
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.2 — Added internal `RibbonLayoutTelemetry` plus package-visible `RibbonLayoutTelemetryRecorder` for deterministic event capture:
  - `tabRebuild(tabId, reason)`
  - `groupRebuild(groupId, reason)`
  - `controlRebuild(controlId, reason)`
  - `collapseTransition(groupId, from, to)`
  - `nodeCacheHit(kind, id)` / `nodeCacheMiss(kind, id)`
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.2 — Wired telemetry to the new cache invariants:
  - identical refreshes now emit cache hits without rebuilds
  - structural deltas rebuild only the changed surface
  - collapse transitions emit ordered `from`/`to` state changes
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.3 — Fixed the pre-existing accumulator double-merge bug by removing the in-constructor `merge(initial)` from `TabAccumulator` and `GroupAccumulator`.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.3 — Added a targeted `RibbonManagerTest` regression that proves a single tab + single group contribution yields exactly one merged control.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.4 — Introduced `RibbonIconLoader` with SVG support and graceful fallback:
  - keeps the SPI unchanged (`RibbonIconHandle` string paths only)
  - supports existing octicon pseudo-URIs
  - renders path-based SVG resources through JavaFX `SVGPath`
  - logs `WARNING` and falls back to the existing raster path / alternate icon handle when SVG parsing fails
  - intentionally uses no new Maven dependency; rationale captured in `adr-0001-svg-icons.md`
- [2026-04-21] Phase 3.5 — Expanded deterministic tests in `papiflyfx-docking-docks`:
  - steady-state node-cache reuse
  - structural control-add telemetry
  - full collapse/restore transition ordering
  - accumulator merge regression
  - SVG parse failure with raster fallback
- [2026-04-21] Ran the required Phase 3 preflight validation again before the Phase 4 schema refactor:
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-api,papiflyfx-docking-docks -am compile` → `BUILD SUCCESS`
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-api,papiflyfx-docking-docks -am -Dtestfx.headless=true test` → `BUILD SUCCESS` (`84` tests, `0` failures, `0` errors)
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-github,papiflyfx-docking-hugo,papiflyfx-docking-samples -am compile` → `BUILD SUCCESS`
- [2026-04-21] Phase 4.1 — Replaced the dedicated `DockSessionData.ribbon` field with a deterministic namespaced extension container:
  - `DockSessionData` now stores extension payloads under `extensions.<namespace>` and canonicalizes namespace ordering for stable JSON output.
  - session schema version advanced from `2` to `3`.
  - compatibility with the old top-level `ribbon` payload is intentionally not preserved for Ribbon 2; no legacy bridge was added.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 4.2 — Generalized the contributor SPI around extension namespaces and codecs:
  - `DockSessionStateContributor<T>` now declares `extensionNamespace()` plus a typed `DockSessionExtensionCodec<T>`.
  - `DefaultDockSessionService` captures/restores contributor-owned payloads through codecs instead of mutating the whole `DockSessionData`.
  - `DockManager.registerSessionStateContributor(...)` now rejects duplicate namespaces explicitly with a fail-fast `IllegalArgumentException`.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 4.3 — Moved ribbon persistence onto the generalized extension path:
  - `RibbonSessionStateContributor` now owns namespace `ribbon`.
  - `RibbonSessionCodec` encodes/decodes `RibbonSessionData` through `extensions.ribbon`.
  - Phase 2/3 ribbon invariants remain intact: QAT persistence stays ID-first, missing commands remain pinned but unresolved, and missing selected tabs still fall back gracefully.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 4.4 — Hardened session deserialization with typed shape readers and extension isolation:
  - `DockSessionSerializer` now uses reusable map/list/string/number readers for floating, minimized, maximized, bounds, and restore-hint parsing.
  - malformed core session fields now fail with field-specific `IllegalArgumentException` messages such as `dockSession.floating[0].bounds.width`.
  - malformed extension payloads no longer poison unrelated restore state: non-object or malformed extension entries are dropped with warnings, and codec decode failures are isolated to the owning contributor.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 4.5 — Expanded persistence-focused regression coverage:
  - serializer round-trip with multiple extension namespaces and deterministic ordering
  - ribbon persistence assertions against the new `extensions.ribbon` JSON shape
  - duplicate extension namespace rejection
  - malformed extension payload tolerance during restore
  - malformed core-session diagnostics from the new serializer helpers
- [2026-04-21] Ran the required Phase 4 preflight validation before starting Phase 5 provider/doc work:
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-api,papiflyfx-docking-docks -am compile` → `BUILD SUCCESS`
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-api,papiflyfx-docking-docks -am -Dtestfx.headless=true test` → `BUILD SUCCESS` (`88` tests, `0` failures, `0` errors)
  - `./mvnw -pl papiflyfx-docking-github,papiflyfx-docking-hugo,papiflyfx-docking-samples -am compile` → `BUILD SUCCESS`
- [2026-04-21] Phase 5.1 — Migrated the remaining shipped ribbon providers off the deprecated raw-node bridge:
  - `GitHubRibbonProvider` and `HugoRibbonProvider` now resolve their action integrations through `RibbonContext#capability(Class)`.
  - provider tests now build contexts with typed capability maps and explicitly prove command routing/enablement still works when the legacy `activeContentNode` attribute is absent.
  - the docks runtime bridge remains temporarily populated so non-migrated hosts/providers outside this compile-critical scope are not disturbed by this prompt.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 5.2 — Published contributor/runtime guidance for Ribbon 2 contracts:
  - `RibbonContext`, `RibbonContextAttributes`, and ribbon package docs now spell out the intended split: attributes are metadata/visibility hints, capabilities are executable integrations.
  - `DockSessionStateContributor` and `DockSessionExtensionCodec` now document the `extensions.<namespace>` ownership model, stable namespace expectations, codec responsibility boundaries, and malformed-payload isolation behavior.
  - `CommandRegistry` and `papiflyfx-docking-docks/README.md` now document canonical command identity, stable tab/command IDs for persisted ribbon/QAT state, FX-thread ownership, and the Phase 2/3 cache-reuse and telemetry invariants.
- [2026-04-21] Phase 5.3 — Closed validation/docs gaps without reopening already-green work:
  - audited Phase 2-4 coverage and kept the existing QAT restore, adaptive-layout telemetry, and extension round-trip regressions as the authoritative proof for those earlier invariants.
  - added only the missing provider-facing coverage for typed capability resolution and command routing after the provider migration.
  - verified no compile fallout in `papiflyfx-docking-samples`; no sample code changes were required.

  - `SamplesSmokeTest`: `12` tests, `0` failures, `0` errors

### Packaging validation

- Not required for this session.
- `clean package` was not run because the SVG loader intentionally added no new dependency.

## New and changed invariants

- Canonical command identity remains owned by `RibbonManager` and `CommandRegistry`; Phase 3 assumes that if the manager re-emits the same canonical command id, command-backed control nodes can be reused safely.
- `RibbonTabStrip` now treats tab button nodes as persistent render surfaces keyed by tab id. Identical refreshes produce `nodeCacheHit(TAB, tabId)` and no tab rebuild.
- `Ribbon` now treats `RibbonGroup` instances as persistent render surfaces keyed by `(tabId, groupId)`. Identical refreshes produce `nodeCacheHit(GROUP, tabId/groupId)` and no group rebuild.
- `RibbonGroup` now treats non-collapsed control nodes as persistent render surfaces keyed by `(tabId, groupId, controlId, RibbonGroupSizeMode)`. Identical refreshes in the same size mode produce `nodeCacheHit(CONTROL, ...)` and no control rebuild.
- Structural deltas at the group level may reuse the same `RibbonGroup` node while invalidating only the changed control ids. In the control-add path, unchanged controls remain cache hits and only the new control emits `controlRebuild(..., STRUCTURAL)`.
- Adaptive layout no longer resets every group to `LARGE` before recomputing. Shrink and grow are incremental and deterministic from the current size-state graph.
- The Phase 1 collapse contract is authoritative: smaller `collapseOrder` values collapse earlier. The prompt text also mentioned “highest collapseOrder first” in one test bullet; this implementation follows the Phase 1/Javadoc contract instead.
- `TabAccumulator` and `GroupAccumulator` constructors no longer merge their initial contribution eagerly. The only merge now happens in the outer `computeIfAbsent(...).merge(...)` flow.
- SVG icon support is best-effort and internal. Parsing/render failure must never propagate to providers; the loader logs a `WARNING` and falls back to raster loading.
- Dock session extension persistence is now namespaced and contributor-owned. New extension state must be written under `extensions.<namespace>` rather than as new top-level `DockSessionData` fields.
- `DockSessionStateContributor<T>` now owns both a stable namespace and a typed codec. Contributors no longer mutate the whole captured session object directly.
- Duplicate session contributor namespaces are invalid and fail fast at registration time; there is no silent last-write-wins path.
- Session schema version `3` is the authoritative Ribbon 2 persistence shape. The old top-level `ribbon` payload is intentionally unsupported after this cutover.
- Malformed extension payloads are isolated from core restore: serializer-level shape failures drop only the broken extension entry, and codec-level decode failures are logged per contributor without aborting layout restore.
- Remaining provider integrations should treat `RibbonContextAttributes.ACTIVE_CONTENT_NODE` as transitional only. Attributes are metadata/visibility inputs; typed capabilities are the action-resolution contract.
- Stable ribbon tab and command identifiers are now explicitly part of the persisted contract because selected-tab state and QAT state are restored by ID rather than by rebuilt object identity.

## Open risks and follow-ups

- `RibbonIconLoader` currently supports path-based SVG documents, which is sufficient for icon-grade assets but not a general SVG renderer. Multi-element icons that rely on richer SVG features may still fall back to raster handles.
- Hidden contextual tabs keep their cached `RibbonGroup` instances so they can reappear without reconstruction. This is intentional for Phase 3 efficiency, but it means cache lifetime is tied to the ribbon host lifetime rather than visible-tab lifetime.
- `ACTIVE_CONTENT_NODE` is still populated in `RibbonContextAttributes` by the docks runtime as a deliberate temporary bridge. Phase 5 migrated the remaining shipped providers away from it, but broad removal remains a later cleanup task.
- Because compatibility was intentionally cut, any persisted session produced before Phase 4 with a top-level `ribbon` payload will not restore ribbon state on schema version `3` hosts.

## Next tasks

1. Remove the transitional `ACTIVE_CONTENT_NODE` bridge from the docks runtime once all remaining downstream/internal consumers have moved to typed capabilities.
2. Keep future ribbon providers on stable tab/group/control/command identifiers so persisted selected-tab and QAT state remain valid.
3. Use `extensions.<namespace>` for any new dock-session extension instead of adding bespoke top-level schema fields.

## Handoff snapshot — Phase 5

Lead Agent: `@core-architect`  
Task Scope: Ribbon 2 Phase 5 — provider migration to typed capabilities, contributor/runtime documentation closure, targeted provider regression coverage, and final validation/handoff.  
Impacted Modules: `papiflyfx-docking-api`, `papiflyfx-docking-docks`, `papiflyfx-docking-github`, `papiflyfx-docking-hugo`, `spec/papiflyfx-docking-docks/2026-04-20-0-ribbon-2/**`.

- `papiflyfx-docking-hugo/src/main/java/org/metalib/papifly/fx/hugo/ribbon/HugoRibbonProvider.java`

Files Changed — Phase 5 tests/spec:

- `papiflyfx-docking-github/src/test/java/org/metalib/papifly/fx/github/ribbon/GitHubRibbonProviderTest.java`
- `papiflyfx-docking-hugo/src/test/java/org/metalib/papifly/fx/hugo/ribbon/HugoRibbonProviderTest.java`
- `spec/papiflyfx-docking-docks/2026-04-20-0-ribbon-2/progress.md`

Documentation updated for contributor onboarding:

- typed capability vs attribute guidance at the ribbon SPI boundary
- `extensions.<namespace>` ownership and codec responsibilities
- malformed-payload isolation behavior for extension restore
- stable ribbon command/tab identifiers for persisted selected-tab and QAT state
- `CommandRegistry` ownership, thread-affinity, and steady-state cache/telemetry invariants

Reviewer focus:

- `@ui-ux-designer` — verify the README/API guidance on stable ribbon identifiers and capability-vs-attribute usage matches the intended provider authoring model.
- `@feature-dev` — confirm the GitHub/Hugo providers now use typed capabilities only and that the contributor docs are clear enough for future feature modules.
- `@qa-engineer` — review the new provider tests as the missing Phase 5 proof and confirm the earlier QAT/adaptive-layout/extension regressions are referenced rather than duplicated.
- `@ops-engineer` — confirm the validation matrix and compile/test outcomes are fully recorded, including the provider-reactor test slice and samples smoke run.
- `@spec-steward` — verify Phase 5 closure, the remaining intentional bridge note, and the handoff summary align with the completed scope.

Residual risks:

- the docks runtime still populates the deprecated `ACTIVE_CONTENT_NODE` attribute until the broader cleanup lands
- compatibility with pre-Phase-4 persisted `ribbon` payloads remains intentionally unsupported
